* Concept
- Album publishing Helper
- Order Tracks
- Simple Tool
- Select Audio from Different Locations -> don't Rename for order
- User Friendly
- Auto detect environment
  Folder Name -> Album Title
  cover.png -> album Cover
  vid.mp4 -> render album video
  metadata.txt -> song metadata
  desc.txt -> generate Youtube description with timestamps
  global config for defaults eg. Artist, Genere, (Logo?), YT description
- Only update as needed
- cleanup
- Render format presets eg. Flac, Wave, mp3, raw -> FFMPEG wrapper
- Output Goals: render Tracks, Merge into single, render with video, generate Description, code?
  - Mp3 for CD
  - Wav for HQ Listening
  - Amuse for publishing?
  - Flac = wav alternative
  - Full
  - Video for Youtube
- Publisher Helpers, eg YT API, (Uplaod Amuse -> Ask for API ^w^)? ->
ex.
#+begin_src
PPublish $ [format_preset] -> folders Flac,Wav,mp3,amuse
PPublish $ publish "Youtube" => render video, gen description, API calls
PPublish $ publish "amuse" => render amuse preset, API calls

** First start
- Dont copy Settings -> reference Settings -> Overlays
** CLI
- Set options inside State
- Execute Jobs
** On Job
- Diff with prev State
- Send Changes to Job -> Job can weight changes to minimize work
- Afer Job apply diff to Jobs State and safe in .ppub
** .ppub
- Stores all Settings of the Album, must be version safe
- Stores "current" environment State as well as all "current" States of the Jobs

* Jobs
** Convert Jobs
- Tracks -> format -> Track Folder
- If Track changes / Rename change that track and its hash
- Safely "remove" unknown interfering files -> junk
- Only rerender when required -> least amount of work
** TODO  Merge Jobs
- Merge audio Files into single File
- Full -> also needs format
- Video -> also has format
- can this be combined with Folder worker somehow? -> express mergeing within format Setting file syntax
** Generator
- extract metadata to generate ex. description timestamps
** Publish
- This is its own category
- Upload the Project to YT
- Amuse API
* Configuration
- Global Config for Jobs
- Global defualt metadata
- Metadata can be overwritten by local Config
- Dialog for writing local/global config
- Aeson Serialization
* Environment Scan
- Folder -> Album Name
- best fit Image, Text and Video -> Cover, metadata, YT Description, Video
- Default add cur dir to tracked Folders
- Copy global Settings to local instance
* CLI
- Add single Tracks or new Tracked Folders

* Store
** KILL Version Safe in case of additional future Flags
Aseson
** TODO Order Overwrite
- Store if order has been set for tracks
- Needs to update in case of track deletion
* FFMpeg
- Add custom FFMPEG scripts
- Scripts are Modules
- Folder Modules -> foreach file
- concat Modules -> concat to single
- Metadata
* V2
** Validate
- Modules produce Targets
- Targets can be validated by cached / move
- unvalidated Targets get rerendered
** Modules
- Store info about last State
- calculate nessercery tasks
